# AngularAppExample

Simple Angular example APP, that displays list of employees.

## Features

## TODOS

 * At least two waves of Refactoring
 * Move Employee components and services into its own module
 * Move ErrorHandlerService into common-components module
 * Add config class to submodules
    * pass its instance with data from config file as module config
 * Add more tests
